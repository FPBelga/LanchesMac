These license terms are an agreement between you and Fast Reports Inc. (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above. These conditions apply to the above software.

 

**IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.**

1.  **INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

​      a.  **Individual License.** If you are an individual working on your own applications, either to sell or for any other purpose, you may use the software to develop and test those applications.

​      b.  **Organizational License.** If you are an organization, your users may use the software as follows:

​         i.  Any number of your users may use the software to develop and test applications released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software licenses.

​         ii.  Any number of your users may use the software to develop and test reports to FastReport Open Source. 

​        iii.  Any number of your users may use the software to develop and test your reports as part of online or in person classroom training and education, or for performing academic research.

​        iv.  If none of the above apply, and you are also not an enterprise (defined below), then up to 5 of your individual users can use the software concurrently to develop and test your reports.

​         v.  If you are an enterprise, your employees and contractors may not use the software to develop or test your reports, except for: (i) open source; (ii) FastReport Open Source; and, (iii) education purposes as permitted above. 

​		**An “enterprise”** is any organization and its affiliates who collectively have either (a) more than 250 PCs or users or (b) one million U.S. dollars (or the equivalent in other currencies) in annual revenues, and “affiliates” means those entities that control (via majority ownership), are controlled by, or are under common control with an organization.

 c.   **Workloads.** These license terms apply to your use of the workloads made available to you within the software, except to the extent a workload, or a workload component comes with different license terms and support policies.

 d.  **Backup Copy.** You may make one backup copy of the software, for reinstalling the software.

 e.  **Online Services in the Software.** Some features of the software make use of online services to provide you information about updates to the software or extensions, or to enable you to retrieve content, collaborate with others, or otherwise supplement your development experience. As used throughout this agreement, the term “software” includes these online service features, and by using them, you consent to the transmission of information as described in Section 6, DATA.

 f.   **Demo Use.** The uses permitted above include use of the software in demonstrating your applications.

 g.  **Previews.** You may use any number of copies of software, components, or features (“preview channel software”) FastReport may make available to you through the Preview Channel only for internal evaluation purposes. Fast Reports Inc. may also make available to you preview features or components (“preview features”) through the Current Channel. Preview features may be used consistent with your use rights to FastReport Community. Preview Channel software and preview features (collectively, “previews”), the Preview Channel, and Current Channel are further described at https://github.com/FastReports/FastReport. Previews are experimental and may be substantially different from the commercially released version. They may not operate correctly or work the way a final version will. Fast Reports may change previews for the final, commercial version, if any. Fast Reports is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to you for previews. 

2.  **TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS.**

a.  **Build Devices.** You may copy and install files from the software onto your build devices, including physical devices and virtual machines or containers on those machines, whether on-premises or remote machines that are owned by you, or dedicated solely to your use (collectively, “Build Devices”). You and others in your organization may us these files on your Build Devices solely to compile, build, and verify applications developed by using the software, or run quality or performance tests of those applications as part of the build process. 

b.  **Code Inspection.** This software includes functions that allow you to check the construction of a report and reproduce the source code of this report. Use of these features of the software is entirely optional. By using this feature, you acknowledge that the report and its source code may be protected by copyright and trademark laws. You also agree not to violate any applicable copyright and trademark laws or license agreements and represent that you will have obtained permission or otherwise have the right to check the constructed report and reproduce its source code if you use this functionality. Fast Reports is not responsible for any uses by you in violation of applicable laws or license agreements.

c.   **Fonts.** While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only (i) embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and (ii) temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.

d.  **Licenses for Other Components.** 

​    **i.**  **FastReport components.** The software may include components from FastReport .NET, FastReport Core, or other Fast Reports software. These components are governed by separate agreements and their own product support policies described on the official Fast Reports website attached to the software, except that, if license terms for those components are also included in the associated installation directory, those license terms control. 

​    **ii.**  **Third party Components.** The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the notices file(s) accompanying the software. 

3.  **Restriction of use.** Engaging in any of the activities listed below will terminate the software license. In addition to software license termination, Fast Reports Inc. May pursue criminal, civil, or any other available remedies.

4.  **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights to use the software. Fast Reports Inc. reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not:

●    work around any technical limitations in the software;

●    reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and only to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included with the software;

●    remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Fast Reports or its suppliers in the software;

●    use the software in any way that is against the law; 

●    share, publish, rent or lease the software; or 

●    provide the software as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of your applications for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

5.  **SUPPORT**. Because the software is “as is”, we may not provide support services for it.

6.  **ENTIRE AGREEMENT**. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

7. **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS**. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. 

   Fast Reports will only be liable for slight negligence if Fast Reports is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called “cardinal obligations”). In other cases of slight negligence, Fast Reports will not be liable for slight negligence.

9.  **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS”. YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. FAST REPORTS GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, FAST REPORTS EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

10. **LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM FAST REPORTS AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.**

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

It also applies even if Fast Reports knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
